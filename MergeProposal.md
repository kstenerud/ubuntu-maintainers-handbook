Opening a Merge Proposal
========================

When you want to push changes to a package, the first step is to open a merge proposal (MP).  The merge proposal is where you discuss the reasoning for the proposed change, and where reviewers have the opportunity to comment on it.

Once the MP is approved, if you have upload rights you can then upload the package via 'dput'.  If you do not have upload rights, you'll work with a "sponsor" that will do the upload for you.


### Prepare a Description

The description is free-form, but should contain everything you did. Let the reviewer know if you'll need sponsorship.  You should also append the dep8 results.

Example SRU merge proposal:

    Cherry-picked existing cosmic fix from 8581dd80e48e4e9793236b178b5c9aceeb133966 in pkg/ubuntu/cosmic-devel:

          * debian/patches/fix-postconf-segfault.diff: Fix a postconf segfault
            when map file cannot be read. Thanks to Viktor Dukhovni <postfix-
            users@dukhovni.org>. (LP: #1753470)

    Please tag & sponsor.

    PPA: ppa:kstenerud/postfix-fix-lp1753470-postconf-segfault

    Steps to test:

    # lxc launch images:ubuntu/bionic builder
    # lxc exec builder bash

    # apt dist-upgrade
    # apt install -y postfix
    # touch /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
    # chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/valiases.cf
    # echo "virtual_alias_maps = pgsql:/etc/postfix/valiases.cf" >> /etc/postfix/main.cf
    # su - ubuntu
    $ /usr/sbin/postconf virtual_alias_map

    * This should crash.

    # sudo add-apt-repository -ys ppa:kstenerud/postfix-fix-lp1753470-postconf-segfault
    # sudo apt upgrade
    /usr/sbin/postconf virtual_alias_map

    * This should not crash.

    Package Test Results:

    autopkgtest [11:15:08]: test postfix: - - - - - - - - - - results - - - - - - - - - -
    postfix PASS
    autopkgtest [11:15:09]: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ summary
    postfix PASS


### Open a Merge Proposal

You'll need to have a branch set up for your package.

 * Go to your git repos (https://code.launchpad.net/~your-username/+git) and navigate through.
 * Click on your postfix repo.
 * Under `Branches`, click on your branch.
 * Click `Propose for merging`

   * **Target repository:** Should be correct already (`lp:ubuntu/+source/somepackage`)
   * **Target branch:** The release you are changing the package for, example `ubuntu/bionic-devel`
   * **Commit message:** (leave empty)
   * **Description:** Your merge proposal description
   * **Reviewer:** `canonical-server`

 * Click "Propose Merge"

You'll get a merge proposal page like https://code.launchpad.net/~kstenerud/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+git/postfix/+merge/353267


### Determine the Second Reviewer

There are three options for the second reviewer, depending on what type of package it is:

 * canonical-server-motu-reviewers (for universe packages)
 * canonical-server-packageset-reviewers (for server packages)
 * canonical-server-core-reviewers (for core/main packages)

You can see what kind of package it is with `apt-cache policy`. For example:

    $ apt-cache policy postfix
    postfix:
      Installed: 3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1~ppa1
      Candidate: 3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1~ppa1
      Version table:
     *** 3.3.0-1ubuntu0.1~ppa1 500
            500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/kstenerud/postfix-postconf-segfault-1753470/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
         3.3.0-1 500
            500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages

It's in main, so we won't use `canonical-server-motu-reviewers`. We can use `ubuntu-upload-permission` to determine which of the others it belongs to:

    $ ubuntu-upload-permission -a postfix
    Please enter password for encrypted keyring: 
    All upload permissions for postfix:

    Component (main)
    ================
    * Ubuntu Core Development Team (ubuntu-core-dev) [team]

    Packagesets
    ===========

    core:

    You can not upload postfix to cosmic, yourself.
    But you can still contribute to it via the sponsorship process: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess

It only lists core, so the second reviewer is `canonical-server-core-reviewers`.

#### Add the Second Reviewer

 * Click "Request another review" in the reviewer section.
 * Type in `canonical-server-core-reviewers`


### Get Sponsorship

Before [asking your sponsor to upload](Sponsorship.md), it is wise to verify that your proposed upload does build, does fix the issue and does not regress anything. If you have reason to believe that issues may manifest differently on different architectures, then it is wise to test these as well. The reason to test before sponsorship and upload is that the sponsorship process takes time (and for an SRU, the additional SRU process), so if a problem is detected later it will take longer to go through the sponsorship and SRU review processes again to resolve it. For SRUs, note that the final testing is performed during SRU verification later, so the testing recommended at the stage of preparing an SRU is just some very basic smoke testing to find likely problems. Thorough testing can be performed later to avoid duplicate effort.

Once your MP has been reviewed, request sponsorship, pointing to the git commit at the head:

    Please sponsor this MP. Git commit: 566d8c9eff6a13c25c2ef5f5d9e176f49c52a3b4

The sponsor will tag the upload and dput it to where it belongs.

Retiring a Merge Proposal
=========================

If a merge proposal should no longer land as-is, you have four options:

1. *Mark it Rejected*. You can do this by changing the Status of the
merge proposal from near the top left of the Web UI. Doing this will
remove it from the [Active Reviews page](https://code.launchpad.net/~canonical-server/+activereviews).

2. *Force push a replacement*. If the essential topic of the change
should remain, but the proposed changes be completely replaced, then you
can force push to the source branch. This will cause all previous merge
proposal comments and the source branch name to be retained, but to
progress the merge proposal by proposing a replacement set of commits.

3. *Supersede the merge proposal*. You can do this by using the
"Resubmit proposal" link near the top right of the Web UI. This allows
you to create a replacement merge proposal that links to the one being
superseded. The supserseded merge proposal will be marked as such. This
allows you to supply a new branch name and start with a fresh set of
comments, but without losing the previous history.

4. *Delete the merge proposal*. You can do this by using the "Delete
proposal to merge" link near the top right of the Web UI. This should
generally only be done as a last resort since it will lose all history,
such as comments, as if the merge proposal had never existed. This might
be necessary for appropriateness or legal reasons, but normally we'd
prefer to use one of the other options since retaining the history of
what happened may be useful in the future.
